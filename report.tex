\begin{abstract}
The \textbf{EcoSenseNet - Smart Environment Prediction and  Alert System} presents the design and development of a smart mini-satellite system intended for environmental monitoring and offline communication within a college campus network. The concept comes from frequent network disruptions in Manipur, where internet outages during disasters hinder effective communication and environmental awareness. This project aims to overcome such challenges by creating a localized, self-sufficient network that can predict environmental changes and broadcast alerts completely offline.

The system operates through a multi-phase implementation distributed across three laptops acting as interconnected nodes. In the first phase, Laptop A, located in the administrative block, collects real-time data using sensors such as MQ4, MQ7, MQ135, MQ2, DHT22, and a flame sensor connected to a Heltec LoRa V3 (ESP32). The Arduino IDE is used to log this data into a CSV file at three-minute intervals. Once sufficient readings are captured, the system converts the data into a JSON payload and forwards it to a FastAPI server running locally. The FastAPI backend hosts a pre-trained Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model that analyzes recent patterns and predicts environmental conditions—such as gas concentration, temperature, and humidity—for the next three hours.

In the second phase, the prediction results are exported to a locally hosted Reticulum MeshChat web application. Reticulum, operating through the Heltec LoRa transceiver, transmits the forecast data to another laptop (Laptop B) located in the hostel block. This second node receives the message offline via LoRa and rebroadcasts it over a shared Wi-Fi network using Reticulum’s local web relay feature. Students’ laptops (Laptop C) connected to the same Wi-Fi can instantly access the alerts through Reticulum running on specific ports—port 8000 for full message interaction and port 8080 for read-only access.

The system not only transmits automated environmental alerts but also includes an integrated chat interface that allows administrative staff to send important messages to students, ensuring campus-wide communication even during network failures. All these processes operate entirely offline without depending on cloud services or the internet.

By combining IoT-based sensing, machine learning prediction, and decentralized mesh communication, \textbf{EcoSenseNet - Smart Environment Prediction and  Alert System} demonstrates a feasible, low-cost, and resilient environmental monitoring framework. Its hybrid design—merging electronics, embedded systems, and intelligent networking—illustrates how modern technologies can be adapted to create disaster-ready communication systems in rural and educational environments where connectivity is limited.
