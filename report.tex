\chapter*{ABSTRACT}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{ABSTRACT}
Traditional Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems are plagued by issues of data security, interoperability, and patient privacy. Centralized architectures are vulnerable to breaches, and patients often lack control over their own medical information. This project, \textbf{MediVault}, introduces a blockchain-based healthcare data sharing system designed to address these critical challenges. By leveraging Ethereum, Solidity smart contracts, and a decentralized architecture, MediVault empowers patients with full ownership and control over their encrypted medical records.

The system facilitates secure and transparent data exchange between patients, doctors, and researchers. A key innovation of this project is the \textbf{Anonymized Opt-in Research Module}, which allows patients to voluntarily contribute de-identified data for scientific research while maintaining full, revocable control over their consent. This feature creates an ethical framework for large-scale data analysis without compromising individual privacy. The implementation demonstrates a robust, patient-centric model that ensures data integrity, security, and accountability, paving the way for a more transparent and ethical healthcare ecosystem.
